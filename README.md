### Cancer-risk prediction for diabetic patients
Using real-world EHR data of diabetic patients, we aim to build a predictive model to identify patients in risk of developing cancer in the coming X years. For this, we train a model using past medical history that are collected during their routine visits.

### MiMic-king summary stat-based model in digital health
Lots of recent ML models built in digital health for different predictive tasks use summary statistics features, which later may lead to unhelpful conclusions or does not provide much utility.
